        <h2>Consume less</h2>
        <p>
          Curbing consumption can have a huge impact on the environment. The
          three "R's"—reduce, reuse and recycle— get a lot of attention, but the
          planet could benefit from some focus on the most important and most
          underrepresented "R": refuse
        </p>
        <h2>Compost</h2>
        <p>
          Another “R” that doesn’t get much attention but has important
          environmental implications is “rot.” As in, let your food and yard
          waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to the landfill.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words: compost. Composting your food scraps and yard waste
          offers double rewards: it keeps an incredible amount of trash out of
          the waste stream, and it produces free, rich soil to use in your
          garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some cities now pick up organic waste alongside regular trash and
          recycling pick up. If your area doesn’t offer this service, no
          worries— you can set up a low-maintenance compost pile in your
          backyard.

        <h2>Choose reusable over single-use</h2>
        <p>
          Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages from
          disposable cups or disposable bottles, sipping from disposable straws,
          carrying disposable grocery bags, eating from disposable plates or
          containers and using disposable utensils.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that single-use plastic has to go somewhere, and it’s had a
          devastating effect on our soil, oceans and marine life.
        </p>
        <h2>Upcycle more</h2>
        <p>
          Get creative with your useless or unwanted items by
          upcycling—basically, turning trash into treasure. Creating something
          new such as artwork, toys or jewelry is both satisfying and one of the
          best ways to protect the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does it keep items out of the trash, it can prevent having to
          purchase new items, which require lots of resources to produce.
          Children love making things; so instead of heading to the craft store,
          check out your recycle bin first and let their imaginations soar!
        </p>
        <h2>Recycle properly</h2>
        <p>
          If you can’t refuse it…and you can’t rot it…and you can’t reduce
          it…and you can’t upcycle or reuse it…then it’s time to turn to the
          final “R”—recycling. Educate yourself on what can and cannot be
          recycled in your bins at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throwing the wrong items in the recycle bin can result in an entire
          load being rejected, which means … back to the landfill.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also easily find out how to recycle special items such as
          electronics, batteries and appliances. Check with your local
          municipality for drop-off sites, and make an effort to get your items
          to the proper disposal sites.

        <h2>Use fewer chemicals</h2>
        <p>
          Want to protect the environment? Use fewer harmful chemicals and
          you’ll be on the right track. It’s hard to be sure about the long-term
          negative effects chemicals can have, both on our bodies and on the
          planet, so it’s best to avoid them if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opt for chemical-free lawn and garden care; all-natural beauty and
          hygiene items; natural household cleaners; and organic food. The Earth
          will thank you!
        </p>
        <h2>Use less water</h2>
        <p>
          Conserving water at home is one of the easiest ways to protect the
          environment. Think of all the times you consume water, both inside and
          outside your home; then, make adjustments as you can.
        </p>
        <h2>Conserve electricity</h2>
        <p>
          As you can guess, we’re quite fond of this method of protecting the
          environment! Anytime you can use less electricity, it’s a win for the
          planet.
        </p>
        <h2>Plant trees</h2>
        <p>
          They are the lunges of the planet and they help greatly reduce
          pollution by absorbing the CO2 in the air. Plant a tree and help
          safeguard our planet.

    <h2>Faharetana</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Faharetana. I'm from Madagascar, it's the biggest island in the Indian Ocean close to Africa.</p>
    <p>Right now I am working as an Administrative Assistant in our local Port and I'm enrolled in BYU-Idaho to learn more about programming because it has always been a field of interest for me.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, I would like to become a programmer once my studies are over.</p>
    <p>I like to read comics in my free time and I also like listening to music. I am married and have one child.</p>
    <p>I hope we all get along and will help each other during this class. All the best.</p>
